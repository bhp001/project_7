NLP Project for Disaster Tweet Classification

Background:

In today's digital age, social media platforms like Twitter play a crucial role in disseminating information, especially during emergencies and disasters. However, distinguishing between tweets that genuinely indicate a disaster and those that do not can be challenging, even for humans. As a result, there is growing interest from various organizations, such as disaster relief agencies and news outlets, in developing automated methods to monitor Twitter for real-time disaster alerts.

Challenge:
The challenge is to build a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying tweets as either related to real disasters or not. While some tweets may contain explicit keywords like "fire" or "flood," others may use such terms metaphorically or in a non-disaster context. Thus, the model needs to discern the true intent behind the language used in tweets, which can be nuanced and context-dependent.

Objectives:

●	Classification Model Development: Develop a machine learning model that can predict whether a tweet is about a real disaster or not.

●	Accuracy and Precision: Aim for high accuracy and precision in classification to minimize false alarms and ensure timely and accurate disaster detection.

●	Robustness: Create a model that can handle variations in language, including slang, abbreviations, and cultural nuances, to ensure effectiveness across diverse tweet datasets.

●	Scalability: Build a scalable solution capable of processing large volumes of tweets in real-time to support continuous monitoring efforts.

Key Tasks:

Part 1: Data Exploration and Preparation

Part 2: Feature Engineering and Model Selection

Part 3: Model Evaluation and Validation

Part 4: Web Application Development


Results and Insights :

The logistic regression model effectively classified disaster tweets with high precision, demonstrating the importance of feature engineering and model tuning in NLP tasks.

Conclusion :

This project underscores the potential of machine learning in disaster response scenarios, highlighting how NLP can be leveraged to quickly classify critical information from social media.
